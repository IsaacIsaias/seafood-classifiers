# Seafood Classifiers by means of AI-based Algorithms ([Spanish](spa/README.md))

This repository contains:

- The fish dataset used for the project, obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/crowww/a-large-scale-fish-dataset)
- A Jupyter Notebook with two multiclass classifiers:
    1. A Python-code implementation using CNN's, the Keras API and TensorFlow
    2. A No-code classifier using the Azure Custom Vision API
- A [text file](seafood_URLs.txt) that has:
    - 29 URLs of images that can be used to test the classifiers
    - The code that can be used in the Azure CLI for testing
- My [Internship report](TSU-InternshipReport.pdf) (Total: 159 pages)

> Files of my **Associate's Degree Internship Report** in Mechatronics-Automation at the Universidad Tecnológica de San Juan del Río (UTSJR).
